- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GarethLlewellynMetOffice
- Solution Architect for the Broadcast Graphics Team
- If you've seen a weather forecast on television or on social media, we're the team that handles the graphical playthroughs that appear behind the meterologist.
- We have a big push on for moving our base operating system away from RHEL, virtualisation of both applications and server render farms, automation and IaC, and last but not least, all things probabilistic meterological data.
